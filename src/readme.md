# src (game source files)

- the game can be built for the stm32 with fpga, or for desktop (windows and
  linux tested), by editing the `PLATFORM` variable in `makefile`
- stm-specific sources should be in the stm32 folder (setup/configuration code
  using HAL or FreeRTOS), or in `stm32.c` in any subfolder (when used as
  interface implementation)
- stm-specific sources should be declared in `stm32.mk`
- desktop-specific sources should be declared in `ds.mk`
- other source files (both platforms) should be declared in `makefile`
- for small sections of platform specific code, `#ifdef` macro's can be used.
  either `HH_TARGET_STM32` or `HH_TARGET_DESKTOP` is defined.
